# About these files

This folder represents the relevant contents of a DVD-ROM received from a data request to the BCA for public criminal conviction records for the past 10 years.

The most important files are public.xml (here as provided by the BCA as public.xml.exe, a self-unpacking executable, and also as a public.xml.gz which we made for our OSX/*nix friends) and the respective *.xsd files which constitute the schema.

The BCA also provides "public31.exe" and "public95.exe" which appear to be tab-delimeted records (not certain about this--didn't look at them that closely). I think the XML is most structured and useful, but I can provide the other formats if needed.
